        <h1>Fix Styling</h1>
<p>With the new code section styling the index page looked strange. It was clear: I had to fix the styling. But how to do this with only basic CSS knowledge? I started by adding a new class to the code. It's called <code>index-content</code>. Basically I was lost and I'm happy that it works now. Some time later I will learn more about CSS and how to style the blog properly.<br>
With Chrismas coming up I will post one or two more articles and then take a break. I will use the time to spend some time with my family and loved ones.</p>
