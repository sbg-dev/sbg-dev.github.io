        <h1>Setup MacMini M4</h1>
<p>Tranfering the data from the old MacBook to the new MacMini M4. I am using the Migration Assistant to transfer the data. The process is straight forward. I am also installing the software that I need on the new MacMini. I am also setting up the development environment. I will be using the MacMini for development work.</p>
<h2>Using colima</h2>
<p>I wanted to try out colima for a long time now. Today was the day. I installed colima and tried it out. I used a lot of dev containers at my old job. So the setup neded to work with docker compose. After some websearch I found a way to use docker compose with colima.
So basically to use docker compose with colima you need to have docker and docker compose installed.
Here's what I did:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>colima
brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>docker
brew<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>docker-compose

colima<span class="w"> </span>start
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Testing if installation worked</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>docker --version
docker-compose --version
</code></pre></div>

<p>After the installation was complete I tested existing dev conatiners with VSCode and run into some issues. After a long websearch I found out that the cli plugin need to be added to the docker config. I ended up adding the following to the <code>~/.docker/config.json</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;cliPluginsExtraDirs&quot;: [
      &quot;/opt/homebrew/lib/docker/cli-plugins&quot;
]
</code></pre></div>

<p>After adding the cli plugin path to the config file I was able to use the dev containers with VSCode.</p>
