Summary: Understanding the problem with the commit email

# The problem

I realized that my commits are not correctly associated with my GitHub account. I have configured the email in the git configuration, but it is not working. I need to understand why this is happening and how to fix it.

# The solution

The problem is that the email in the git configuration is not the same as the email in the GitHub account. To fix this, you need to set the email in the git configuration to the same email as the GitHub account. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.email "<your-email>"
```

After running this command, your commits will be correctly associated with your GitHub account.

# Avoide exposing your email

I found out that email exposing can be avoided by using the norepy email. If you go to settings -> emails, you can set `Keep my email address private` to true. This will make sure that your email is not exposed in the commits. In the description of the setting, you can see the noreply address.
Keep in mind: If you use commandline pushes then you need to uncheck the `Block command line pushes that expose my email` setting.

# Conclusion

By setting the email in the git configuration to the email of the noreply address, you can ensure that your commits are correctly associated with your GitHub account.
