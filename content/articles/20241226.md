# Add vscode snippet for articles

I've created a new snippet for vscode to make it easier to create new articles. It's straightforward to use. Just open the command palette and search for **Configure Snippet**. I choose to create a new snippet for articles inside this repository. The content is pretty simple and conatins only the metadata that is needed for the articles.

```json
{
  "Add a snippet for articles": {
    "prefix": "article",
    "body": [
      "[]: # Title: $1",
      "[]: # Date: $CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE",
      "[]: # Slug: $2",
      "[]: # Authors: sbg",
      "[]: # Summary: $3",
      "[]: # ",
      "[]: # # $1",
      "[]: # ",
      "[]: # $0"
    ],
    "description": "Add a snippet for articles"
  }
}
```

# Lessons learned
