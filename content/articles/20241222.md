Summary: Fixing the styling of the blog

# Fix Styling

With the new code section styling the index page looked strange. It was clear: I had to fix the styling. But how to do this with only basic CSS knowledge? I started by adding a new class to the code. It's called `index-content`. Basically I was lost and I'm happy that it works now. Some time later I will learn more about CSS and how to style the blog properly.  
With Chrismas coming up I will post one or two more articles and then take a break. I will use the time to spend some time with my family and loved ones.

## Lessons Learned

- learned how to add a new class to the code section
- learned how to style the blog with basic CSS
- to use the developer tools to find out what's wrong with the styling
