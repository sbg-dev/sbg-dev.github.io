# New Year new theme

It's time for my idea to come true. When I started the blog I wanted it to be themed in a way the reflect the current season. This is the new year theme. It needs some work but it's a start. I'm happy with it.

# New build process

I finnaly fount the time to setup the action to build the blog. It was simple to do and I'm happy with the result.  
The next step is to add a branch that will be used to deploy the blog. I'm thinking about using the `gh-pages` branch. I'll see how it goes.
